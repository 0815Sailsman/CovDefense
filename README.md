# CovDefense

Corona-themed tower defense game we built using JavaFX and our custom "Game-Engine". Uses well known german politicians known for their participation in the politics related to the pandemic. This once was a school project for our computer science class, but I decided to keep developing on this project.

## Omicron-Update (Refactoring and Optimizations) ##
- [x] Better separation of GUI and engine
- [x] Rework buttons and towers to load their data from files
- [x] Switch IDEs from Java-Editor to IntellIJ

## Sigma-Update (Content Update) ##
- [ ] New skins
- [ ] Mor eanimations (towers when shooting, projectile-collision...)
- [ ] Main menu
- [ ] Scores
- [ ] Icons for the program
- [ ] Highlight where towers can(not) be placed
- [ ] Balance Changes
- [ ] Add "Scholz"
